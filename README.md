# XStore CLI

This CLI is meant to create, publish and delete XStore packages.

In the future, you will also be able to create XStore Desktop Plugins and/or install them.

## Technologies

We use the `argparse` library to **parse** the command line arguments.

We do also use the XStore's `python-api` to create and publish packages. You can check the repository [here](https://github.com/X-Store-App/python-api).

**Please note that this library is available only for Python 3**
